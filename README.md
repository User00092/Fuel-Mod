# Fuel Mod
The mod developed by [User0092](https://github.com/User00092) for the Stand mod menu incorporates a comprehensive fuel system that operates seamlessly within the game. It offers distinctive fuel tank capacities and fuel consumption rates for every vehicle class available in the game. During gameplay, the fuel level of the player's vehicle depletes in real-time, based on the RPM and fuel consumption, adding an extra layer of realism to the game experience.
